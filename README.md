# Website Spammer in Python

This code opens up a website,enters text into text box and then click the submit button.

The website is a B+ tree simulation.I wanted to test the B+ tree functioning,but was bored to enter data manually, so I wrote this code.

It uses PyAutoGUI for all the GUI functions. 
I also took code for a function for generating random string from StackOverflow :P


# Current Bugs - 
Sometimes the program misses the clicking window when the submit button is disabled when the website is simulating the adding of data. That is due to mismatch of delay. Would be great if you can suggest some good fix for that. Thanks :)
